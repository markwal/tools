# Infocut

Make start menu shortcuts for the Masterpieces of Infocom games.

This is a command line tool where you tell it what interpreter you'd like to 
use.  It also assumes that you've used the infocom tools to rename the game
files to have their versions (because that's what I did and I wrote this tool
for me).

## TODO

One of my round tuits is to make the tool more general so that you can
point it at a set of files and it'll kinda figure out which infocom games they
are and make the right shortcuts.  Maybe someday.
